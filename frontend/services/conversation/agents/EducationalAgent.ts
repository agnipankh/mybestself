Key points to cover:
- A persona represents different roles/identities we embody (Parent, Professional, Creative, etc.)
- A northstar (arÃªte) is the guiding principle that defines excellence for each persona
- Give 2-3 concrete examples of famous people's personas and their northstars

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT ask about their specific personas yet
- DO NOT suggest personas for this user
- Keep it educational and inspiring
- End by asking if they want to learn more or start discovering their own

Be conversational and encouraging.`
